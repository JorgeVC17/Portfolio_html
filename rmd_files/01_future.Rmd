  What are my plans for the future?
</h2>

In the past year, I have found that one of my many passions is programming and I mean programming with focus in the world of data analysis and machine learning techniques. For this reason I would like to keep developing and improving this skills. 

I see myself in the future working as freelancer analyzing and communicating data en proposing how to implement different AI-models and techniques in the projects of various companies and enterprises.This companies/enterprises can be related to the Life Sciences area/sector or not. Because I think that my current skills and the future skills that want to develop can be applied to multiple areas or sector. I think in this way, because in the last years I have applied this knowledge in the **Social sector** where I impart multiple workshops to the youth of how to code in python to use various machine learning techniques for the projects. 

To reach this goal I want to try in every free time that I have to learn a new machine learning technique or library that helps me to communicate easier and better the data that I have analyzed. For this reason my plan for my free schedule is to learn another machine-learning technique. The machine-learning technique that I want to learn is "Computer Vision". I think that this machine-learning technique will be incredibly valuable in the future and for this reason I want to train an algorithm to identify rats. If I succeed the next step will be train an algorithm to identify if a rat have stress or if it's in an optimal state.

  What are my plans for my free schedule?

In the future, I really want to work in "AI modeling." I love learning about different machine learning techniques, and I believe that these techniques going to be crucial for the job market. That's why I want to learn more about machine learning technique **Computer vision**. Because I love the concept behind computer vision. It's like teaching computers to recognize objects, understand scenes, and maybe even make decisions based on what they "see."

Rats are super important in Life Sciences for testing medicines, so being able to track them accurately is a big deal. Plus, understanding how they act is crucial for figuring out how medicines might affect us.

As a fun challenge, I also want to teach the program to tell if a rat is stressed out. Being able to spot stress in rats could help make sure they're okay during experiments, which is really important for ethical reasons.
