[["what-are-my-plans-for-the-future.html", "What are my plans for the future?", " What are my plans for the future? In the past year, I have found that one of my many passions is programming and I mean programming with focus in the world of data analysis and machine learning techniques. For this reason I would like to keep developing and improving this skills. I see myself in the future working as freelancer analyzing and communicating data en proposing how to implement different AI-models and techniques in the projects of various companies and enterprises.This companies/enterprises can be related to the Life Sciences area/sector or not. Because I think that my current skills and the future skills that want to develop can be applied to multiple areas or sector. I think in this way, because in the last years I have applied this knowledge in the Social sector where I impart multiple workshops to the youth of how to code in python to use various machine learning techniques for the projects. To reach this goal I want to try in every free time that I have to learn a new machine learning technique or library that helps me to communicate easier and better the data that I have analyzed. For this reason my plan for my free schedule is to learn another machine-learning technique. The machine-learning technique that I want to learn is “Computer Vision”. I think that this machine-learning technique will be incredibly valuable in the future and for this reason I want to train an algorithm to identify rats. If I succeed the next step will be train an algorithm to identify if a rat have stress or if it’s in an optimal state.
