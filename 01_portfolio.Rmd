## [Data Story](https://github.com/JorgeVC17/Data_story)

-   To test the Python skills I learned during my minor, I challenged myself to develop a Streamlit app where I tell a story using public data. I chose to focus on how climate change affects the increasing prevalence of diseases such as malaria. Developing this data story marked my initial step in my data analysis career.
