  abstract = {The most prominent factor that delays the translation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analyses to clinical practice is the lack of knowledge regarding its origin and composition. The elucidation of the former is complicated by the seemingly random fluctuation of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of cfDNA in the blood of healthy and diseased individuals. Besides methodological discrepancies, this could be ascribed to a web of cellular responses to various environmental cues and stressors. Since all cells release cfDNA, it follows that the cfDNA in the blood of cancer patients is not only representative of tumor derived DNA, but also of DNA released by healthy cells under different conditions. Additionally, cfDNA released by malignant cells is not necessarily just aberrant, but likely includes non-mutated chromosomal DNA fragments. This may cause false positive/negative results. Although many have acknowledged that this is a major problem, few have addressed it. We propose that many of the current stumbling blocks encountered in in vivo cfDNA studies can be partially circumvented by in vitro models. Accordingly, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the release of cfDNA from cultured cells and to gauge its potential use for elucidating the nature of cfDNA. Results suggest that the occurrence of cfDNA is not a consequence of apoptosis or necrosis, but primarily a result of actively secreted DNA, perhaps in association with a protein complex. This study demonstrates the potential of in vitro cell culture models to obtain useful information about the phenomenon of cfDNA.},

  abstract = {Cancer cells shed naked DNA molecules into the circulation. This circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has become the predominant analyte for liquid biopsies to understand the mutational landscape of cancer. Coupled with next-generation sequencing, ctDNA can serve as an alternative substrate to tumor tissues for mutation detection and companion diagnostic purposes. In fact, recent advances in precision medicine have rapidly enabled the use of ctDNA to guide treatment decisions for predicting response and resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies. An advantage of using ctDNA over conventional tissue biopsies is the relatively noninvasive approach of obtaining peripheral blood, allowing for simple repeated and serial assessments. Most current clinical practice using ctDNA has endeavored to identify druggable and resistance mutations for guiding systemic therapy decisions, albeit mostly in metastatic disease. However, newer research is evaluating potential for ctDNA as a marker of minimal residual disease in the curative setting and as a useful screening tool to detect cancer in the general population. Here we review the history of ctDNA and liquid biopsies, technologies to detect ctDNA, and some of the current challenges and limitations in using ctDNA as a marker of minimal residual disease and as a general blood-based cancer screening tool. We also discuss the need to develop rigorous clinical studies to prove the clinical utility of ctDNA for future applications in oncology.},

  abstract = {Precision medicine in the clinical management of cancer may be achieved through the diagnostic platform called ``liquid biopsy''. This method utilizes the detection of biomarkers in blood for prognostic and predictive purposes. One of the latest blood born markers under investigation in the field of liquid biopsy in cancer patients is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA is released by tumor cells through different mechanisms and can therefore provide information about the genomic make-up of the tumor currently present in the patient. Through longitudinal ctDNA-based liquid biopsies, tumor dynamics may be monitored to predict and assess drug response and/or resistance. However, because ctDNA is highly fragmented and because its concentration can be extremely low in a high background of normal circulating DNA, screening for clinical relevant mutations is challenging. Although significant progress has been made in advancing the detection and analysis of ctDNA in the last few years, the current challenges include standardization and increasing current techniques to single molecule sensitivity in combination with perfect specificity. This review focuses on the potential role of ctDNA in the clinical management of cancer patients, the current technologies that are being employed, and the hurdles that still need to be taken to achieve ctDNA-based liquid biopsy towards precision medicine.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: LFSPRO is an R library that implements risk prediction models for Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a genetic disorder characterized by deleterious germline mutations in the TP53 gene. To facilitate the use of these models in clinics, we developed LFSPROShiny, an interactive R/Shiny interface of LFSPRO that allows genetic counselors (GCs) to perform risk predictions without any programming components, and further visualize the risk profiles of their patients to aid the decision-making process. METHODS: LFSPROShiny implements two models that have been validated on multiple LFS patient cohorts: a competing-risk model that predicts cancer-specific risks for the first primary, and a recurrent-event model that predicts the risk of a second primary tumor. Starting with a visualization template, we keep regular contact with GCs, who ran LFSPROShiny in their counseling sessions, to collect feedback and discuss potential improvement. Upon receiving the family history as input, LFSPROShiny renders the family into a pedigree, and displays the risk estimates of the family members in a tabular format. The software offers interactive overlaid side-by-side bar charts for visualization of the patients' cancer risks relative to the general population. RESULTS: We walk through a detailed example to illustrate how GCs can run LFSPROShiny in clinics, from data preparation to downstream analyses and interpretation of results with an emphasis on the utilities that LFSPROShiny provides to aid decision making. CONCLUSION: Since Dec 2021, we have applied LFSPROShiny to over 100 families from counseling sessions at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our study suggests that software tools with easy-to-use interfaces are crucial for the dissemination of risk prediction models in clinical settings, hence serving as a guideline for future development of similar models.},

  abstract = {Liquid biopsies are increasingly used for cancer molecular profiling that enables a precision oncology approach. Circulating extracellular nucleic acids (cell-free DNA; cfDNA), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be isolated from the blood and other body fluids. This review will focus on current technologies and clinical applications for liquid biopsies. ctDNA/cfDNA has been isolated and analyzed using many techniques, e.g., droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, beads, emulsion, amplification, and magnetics (BEAMing), tagged-amplicon deep sequencing (TAm-Seq), cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS-Seq), whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CTCs have been isolated using biomarker-based cell capture, and positive or negative enrichment based on biophysical and other properties. ctDNA/cfDNA and CTCs are being exploited in a variety of clinical applications: differentiating unique immune checkpoint blockade response patterns using serial samples; predicting immune checkpoint blockade response based on baseline liquid biopsy characteristics; predicting response and resistance to targeted therapy and chemotherapy as well as immunotherapy, including CAR-T cells, based on serial sampling; assessing shed DNA from multiple metastatic sites; assessing potentially actionable alterations; analyzing prognosis and tumor burden, including after surgery; interrogating difficult-to biopsy tumors; and detecting cancer at early stages. The latter can be limited by the small amounts of tumor-derived components shed into the circulation; furthermore, cfDNA assessment in all cancers can be confounded by clonal hematopoeisis of indeterminate potential, especially in the elderly. CTCs can be technically more difficult to isolate that cfDNA, but permit functional assays, as well as evaluation of CTC-derived DNA, RNA and proteins, including single-cell analysis. Blood biopsies are less invasive than tissue biopsies and hence amenable to serial collection, which can provide critical molecular information in real time. In conclusion, liquid biopsy is a powerful tool, and remarkable advances in this technology have impacted multiple aspects of precision oncology, from early diagnosis to management of refractory metastatic disease. Future research may focus on fluids beyond blood, such as ascites, effusions, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as methylation patterns and elements such as exosomes.},

  abstract = {Malignant tumors shed DNA into the circulation. The transient half-life of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may afford the opportunity to diagnose, monitor recurrence, and evaluate response to therapy solely through a non-invasive blood draw. However, detecting ctDNA against the normally occurring background of cell-free DNA derived from healthy cells has proven challenging, particularly in non-metastatic solid tumors. In this study, distinct differences in fragment length size between ctDNAs and normal cell-free DNA are defined. Human ctDNA in rat plasma derived from human glioblastoma multiforme stem-like cells in the rat brain and human hepatocellular carcinoma in the rat flank were found to have a shorter principal fragment length than the background rat cell-free DNA (134--144 bp vs. 167 bp, respectively). Subsequently, a similar shift in the fragment length of ctDNA in humans with melanoma and lung cancer was identified compared to healthy controls. Comparison of fragment lengths from cell-free DNA between a melanoma patient and healthy controls found that the BRAF V600E mutant allele occurred more commonly at a shorter fragment length than the fragment length of the wild-type allele (132--145 bp vs. 165 bp, respectively). Moreover, size-selecting for shorter cell-free DNA fragment lengths substantially increased the EGFR T790M mutant allele frequency in human lung cancer. These findings provide compelling evidence that experimental or bioinformatic isolation of a specific subset of fragment lengths from cell-free DNA may improve detection of ctDNA., During cell death, DNA that is not contained within a membrane (i.e., cell-free DNA) enters the circulation. Detecting cell-free DNA originating from solid tumors (i.e., circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA), particularly solid tumors that have not metastasized, has proven challenging due to the relatively abundant background of normally occurring cell-free DNA derived from healthy cells. Our study defines the subtle but distinct differences in fragment length between normal cell-free DNA and ctDNA from a variety of solid tumors. Specifically, ctDNA was overall consistently shorter than the fragment length of normal cell-free DNA. Subsequently, we showed that a size-selection for shorter cell-free DNA fragments increased the proportion of ctDNA within a sample. These results provide compelling evidence that development of techniques to isolate a subset of cell-free DNA consistent with the ctDNA fragment lengths described in our study may substantially improve detection of non-metastatic solid tumors. As such, our findings may have a direct impact on the clinical utility of ctDNA for the non-invasive detection and diagnosis of solid tumors (i.e., the ``liquid biopsy''), monitoring tumor recurrence, and evaluating tumor response to therapy.},
