The diagnosis of a tumor is usually based on morphology and genetic analysis of the biopsied tumor. However, especially in pediatric patients, it's not always feasible to perform a tumor biopsy due to its invasive nature. That's why we, at the group of Lieve Tytgat, at the  Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, investigate the use of liquid biopsies (for example, blood), as an alternative to traditional tissue biopsies. Liquid biopsies are more "patient-friendly", since blood sampling is already part of routine treatment. With a liquid biopsy, you capture cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which is DNA that is not contained in a cell and is circulating in the circulatory system. In cancer patients, part of this cfDNA is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which has been released by tumor cells. Another advantage of liquid biopsies is that it is better capable of capturing tumor heterogeneity, which is not always the case with tumor biopsies. 

In the research project where this project is integrated, we sequence cfDNA and try to compare the genetic aberrations (small nucleotide variation and copy number variation) of tumor and ctDNA from the same patient, and find if ctDNA is representative of the tumor. In this project, the students will improve an existing RShiny application by working on visualisation of the found variation, as well as integrating results from other analysis. Students will also work on the visualisation of copy number aberrations (a type variation in the genome where a certain part is present in different amounts than expected).
This project will require R programming and critical thinking to decide how to best combine and visualise datasets.
