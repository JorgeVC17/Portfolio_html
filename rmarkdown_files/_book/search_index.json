I always wanted to learn something new, something interesting, something that really makes me happy. For all this reasons I’ve have various experiences and works where I develop multiples skills and knowledge.

I enjoy learning about how the human system works and different research methods and articles, as well as the practice lessons where I learned various techniques and skills that are relevant in the medical research world.

During this minor I learned to programming in python to communicate statistical information over the impact of data in our world. I also learned various Machine Learning techniques such as Computer Vision, Classification algorithms and Generative AI and I develop multiple design skills in programs such as Figma where I learned the basic concepts of UI/UX design and the importance of design behind the development of applications and start-up ideas. After this minor I choose to specialise in Data Science, where I learn to programming in R and Bash to communicate statistical information about medical and scientific researches. During this specialization I developed skills such as Next Generation Sequencing techniques, RNA-sequencing, and metagenomics. Besides my academic journey I’ve made some experience as Volunteer Social Worker by The Mall Jongerenwerk Gorinchem, where I mastered skills such as communication and presentation of obtain results to parents and schools, organization of multiple activities, projects and events.
